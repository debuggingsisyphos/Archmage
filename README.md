# Archmage

## General Description

An RPG and 4x-Strategy mix inspired by Battle Brothers, Spellforce: Conquest of Eo, Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, Brotato, Crusader Kings 3 and Civilization, among others.
Not trying to do anything big here, this project is mainly focused on understanding the basics of the godot engine and GDScript and might help others trying to do the same.
Features will be a added as long as motivation and time is available.

## Core Features

***

> Planned:

### Organic Breathing World
A procedurally generated world that makes sense. 
Cities are big because they are economically or strategically important.
Others are small because they aren't.
All Resources that exist and are used are produced by the population in the game and have to be transported to the locations where they are consumed.
Resources are not evenly distributed.
Big and powerful empires are big and powerful because they achieve that status through economic, militaristic, diplomatic or technoglogical means and vice versa for small empires.

As this is a feature that can get more and more fine grained and thought out, it will start very basic and become increasingly complex.

### Enact Influence, Grow your Power
Earn followers, friends and wealth by completing quests.
Use these resources to influence people, groups, cities and states.
Attack trade routes, support groups in their strive for power and increase your magical prowess through powerful artifacts and aquirement of knowledge.

At start, basic quests and followers will be implemented, followed by items and influence actions.

### Bullet Hell Battle Map
Fight hordes of different enemy types in a real time bullet hell mode similar to Brotato.
Use spells and items learned and collected in the strategic map on varying enemies in different terraines.
